1. CONSTANT FUNCTION
This is the simplest function we can think of. f(n) = c, i.e., fir some fixed constant c, such as c = 5, c =27. fo any argument n, the constant function f(n) assignes the value c.
In layman words, it doesnt change the value of n, it will be always be equal to the constant value c.

2. LOGARITHMIC FUCNTION
Ubiquitous presence of the logarithm function, f(n)=logbn, for some constant b > 1.
The value of b is known as base of the logarithm.
The most common base for the log function in computer science is 2, as computers store integers in binary, and common operation is to repeteadly divide an input in half.

3. LINEAR FUNCTION
Simple yet importnatn fucntion is the linear function.
f(n) = n.
Given the input value n, the linear function f assigns the value n itself.

4. THE N-Log-N FUNCTION
the function that assigns to an input n the value of n times the logarithm base-two of n. This funciton grows a little more rapidly than the linear funcition and a lot less rapidly than the quadratic fucntion.
We will see important functions taht exhibits a running time proportional to the n-log-n function. For example the fastest possible algo for sorting n arbitrary values require time proportionate to n log n.

5. QUADRATIC FUNCTION
f(n) = n*2

given an input value n, the function f assigns the product of n with itself.

6. NESTED LOOPS AND QUADRATIC FUNCTION
Where the 1st iteration of a loop uses one operataion, the 2nd uses two operation, the 3rd uses three operation, and so on.
1+2+3.......+(n-2)+(n-1)+n

7. CUBIC FUCNTION AND OTHER POLYNOMIALS
f(n0 = n*3
input value n of the product of n with itself three times.
