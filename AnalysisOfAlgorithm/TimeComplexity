Time Complexity is the study of the efficiency of algorithms. It tells us ow much time is taken b an algorithm to process a given input.

O(n) --> Linear
O(1) --> Constant
O(log n) --> Logarithmic Time --> Given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish the task are decreased by some factor with each step.
O(n^2) --> Quadratic TIme --> Given an input of size n, the number of steps it takes to accomplish a task is square of n.
O(C^n) --> Exponential TIme --> Given the input of size n, the numbers of steps it takes to accomplish a task is a constant to the n power( Pretty large number).
