Recursion is the entirely different way to achieve repetition.

Recrision os the technique by which a function makes one or more calls t itself during execution, or by which a data structure relies upon
smaller instances of the type of structure in its representation.

In programming, recursion provides an elegant and powerful alternative for performing repetitive tasks.
